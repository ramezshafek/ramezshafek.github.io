            <h2>History and Origins</h2>
            <p>Halloween has its roots in ancient Celtic festivals, particularly Samhain, which marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter. It was believed that on the night of October 31st, the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred, allowing spirits to roam the earth. People would light bonfires, wear costumes, and carve turnips to ward off malevolent spirits.</p>
            <p>Over time, these traditions merged with Christian practices, leading to the celebration of All Saints' Day on November 1st and All Hallows' Eve on October 31st, which eventually became Halloween as we know it today.</p>
