            <h2>Origins of Halloween</h2>
            <p>Halloween's roots can be traced back to ancient Celtic and pagan traditions, with its primary precursor being the Celtic festival of Samhain. Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter in Ireland, Scotland, and parts of Europe. It was a time of transition and believed to be a liminal period when the boundary between the living and the dead was thin.</p>
            <p>During Samhain, the Celts lit bonfires and wore costumes made from animal heads and skins to ward off malevolent spirits. They believed that these rituals helped protect them and their livestock as the days grew shorter and colder.</p>

            <h2>Christian Influence</h2>
            <p>With the spread of Christianity, the celebration of Samhain began to merge with Christian observances. In the 8th century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1st as All Saints' Day, a day to honor all saints and martyrs. The evening before, October 31st, became known as All Hallows' Eve, which later evolved into Halloween.</p>
            <p>Christian traditions incorporated some of the customs of Samhain, such as lighting candles and carving turnips or later, pumpkins, into jack-o'-lanterns. However, Halloween retained its association with the supernatural and the idea of spirits returning to the mortal realm.</p>

            <h2>Modern Halloween</h2>
            <p>In the United States, Halloween transformed into a secular holiday with an emphasis on community and child-friendly activities during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trick-or-treating became a popular tradition, where children would dress up in costumes and go door-to-door to collect candy.</p>
            <p>Today, Halloween has evolved into a diverse and widespread celebration that includes costumes, decorations, parties, haunted houses, scary movies, and a variety of treats. It continues to blend elements from its Celtic, Christian, and various cultural origins, making it a fun and festive holiday for people of all ages.</p>
